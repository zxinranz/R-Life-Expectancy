# R-Life-Expectancy

## Introduction
The average life expectancy of a population is the average number of years a person born during the same period is expected to continue living, holding current mortality rates at different ages constant. Comparative analysis of life expectancy per capita reflects the quality of life in a society, measures the health status of the people in a country (or region), and provides important data for insurance companies dealing with life insurance.<br>
Life expectancy is both one of the most important indicators of the health status of the population and a comprehensive indicator of the level of economic and social development of a country or region. Indicators such as life expectancy are one of the most fundamental research elements for evaluating and predicting the quality of the population, measuring the burden of disease, and evaluating the national economy and the quality of life of the population.<br>
The analysis of the main influencing variables of life expectancy can be of great help in the prediction of life expectancy.
